This is a practise project for learning React.

The project uses a YELP API to search for restaurants across the world and get their ratings, locations etc.
It has favorites functionality added behind a Google OAuth wall. Favorites are added/removed to/from local storage.
Light/Dark theme toogle is added and responsive design works nicely.

API Keys are shared because they are only testing keys.
To use YELP API you must first Request temporary access to the demo server on this link: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/

To use "Favorites" functionality you must request access to the Google OAuth login. (Your email needs to be added for testing)
